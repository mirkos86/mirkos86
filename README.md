I am Mirko Serino, a high energy physicist by training. I am from Italy.
I am interested in coding, particularly data science and machine learning. To start off, I attended and graduated from the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch course.
I am currently studying for the freeCodeCam curriculum. 
I have also published a Mathematica repository for my personal physics project. 

For a living, I manage my family company, a pretty big seasonal hospitality business. 
That is also poducing a custom app for take away orders, whose development I am supervising.

You can easily reach me on LinkedIn (link under my picture) or here.
