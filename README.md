I am from Italy, a high energy physicist by training: https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=find%20ea%20serino%2C%20mirko

I am very interested in coding, particularly data science and machine learning. To start off, I attended and graduated from the Udacity Intro to Machine 
Learning with Pytorch course. I am currently studying the freeCodeCamp curriculum. 

For a living, I manage my family company, a hospitality business. 
That is also producing a custom app for take away orders, whose development I am supervising.

You can easily reach me on LinkedIn or via email.
