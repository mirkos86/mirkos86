- I am Mirko Serino, a high energy physicist by training. I am from Italy.
I am interested in data science and machine learning and, to start off, I’m currently attending a Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch course.
I have also published a Mathematica repository for my personal physics prject. Finally, I manage my family company, which is a pretty big bar, cake and ice cream 
shop, but that does ha not produced any code, at least so far :-)

You can easily reach me on LinkedIn (link under my picture) or here.
